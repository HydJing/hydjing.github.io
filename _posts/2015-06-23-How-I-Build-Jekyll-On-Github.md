## 0. Why I build this website

Occasionally found out there is a way host your personal blog in Github, I think it should be very cool thing to do, so I search the ways of buiding blog on Github and I made it !

## 1. get Github ready 

* First thing I need create **Github account** and download **Github on Windows**, <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Click Here</a> can register an Github account and download the Github
* After I get Github ready, just create new repository name `hydjing.github.io`
* Install the Github on Windows and login 
* Clone the repository into somewhere in your hard driver, such as `D:\myFolderName\`. Github automatically create a folder name `hydjing.github.io` in `D:\myFolderName\`

## 2. install the jekyll theme

 > At the first, I was quite confused about the jekyll how to create a blog website. But I found out using <a href="https://github.com/poole/poole" target="_blank">Pool</a> for easily create Jekyll blog website. And I decide use <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">Lanyon Theme</a> for my website.

* After I understand what exactly I should do, I just download the Lanyon theme and unzip into `D:\myFolderName\hydjing.github.io`
* 
* Use Githun commit the changes and push it to Github


## 3. get local environment ready
* install ruby
* install jekyll
* install highlighter, rough and python
* run it!
