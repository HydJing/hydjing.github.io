## Briefly Introduce Myself

Hi, I'm Wei Jing. I am a web developer who living in New Zealand. I have a keen interest in technology. I graduated from [AUT](http://www.aut.ac.nz/) and currently work as junior web developer at an e-commerce company. My career goal is to be a **full stack web developer**.

## Why build this website

Occasionally find [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), so I decide to do this fun thing, and use this opportunity to learn new stuff! And thanks  [HuSong](https://github.com/SooHu) for sharing awesome code and theme!
